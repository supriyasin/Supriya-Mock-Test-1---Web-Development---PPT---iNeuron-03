    "#3. Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In programming, an execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It includes all \n",
    "   the variables, functions, and other resources that are accessible during the execution of that code. Each time a \n",
    "   function is called or a block of code is executed, a new execution context is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To understand execution contexts better, let's break down the different components and their relationships using a diagram.\n",

    "   1. Variable Environment: The variable environment contains all the declared variables and functions within the current \n",
    "      execution context. It's essentially a container for all the identifiers (variable and function names) and their \n",
    "      associated values. The variable environment also includes the special variable \"this,\" which refers to the object\n",
    "      that is currently being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Scope Chain: The scope chain represents the hierarchical chain of outer environments or scopes that are accessible \n",
    "      from the current execution context. It allows variables and functions to be resolved from outer scopes. The scope \n",
    "      chain is used to look up variables that are not found in the current execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Outer Environment: Each execution context has a reference to its outer environment or scope. The outer environment \n",
    "      represents the variables and functions of the parent or enclosing scope. This allows nested functions to access \n",
    "      variables defined in their containing functions or global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. This Value: The \"this\" value refers to the object that the current code is being executed upon. It provides a \n",
    "      context for the execution and is dynamically determined based on how a function is invoked.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   To illustrate the concept, let's consider an example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   function outer() {\n",
    "  var x = 10;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  function inner() {\n",
    "    var y = 20;\n",
    "    console.log(x + y);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  \n",
    "  inner();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "outer();\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, when the outer() function is called, a new execution context is created for it. The variable \n",
    "   environment of this context will include the variable x with a value of 10. The scope chain will contain a\n",
    "   reference to the outer environment, which is the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Next, when the inner() function is called within the outer() function, a new execution context is created for it. \n",
    "   The variable environment of this context will include the variable y with a value of 20. The scope chain will \n",
    "   contain references to both the outer environment of inner() (which is outer()'s variable environment) and the \n",
    "   global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "   By understanding the execution context and its components, developers can determine how variables are accessed,\n",
    "   how function scopes are resolved, and how the \"this\" keyword behaves within their code. It provides a crucial \n",
    "   understanding of the runtime environment and helps in managing and debugging code effectively.\"\"\""
